### Securing Publish/Subscribe
[File](masc/thesis.pdf)

My University of Toronto MASc thesis. A lot of blood, sweat and tears went into this. It contains an exhaustive overview of all the existing research work done to provide any measure of security in a publish/subscribe system, accurate to 2018. It also contains my original work on bringing Trusted Execution Environments to publish/subscribe.

This thesis is (as of this writing) available at my profile page at the [Middleware Systems Research Group website](http://msrg.org/profiles/javier). I re-uploaded to this repo to have a permanent link to it that I have control over.
